      <p><span>First Day</span> - Orientation day - getting to know classmates. Very excited to be part of this class. I need to remember to send an email to Dr. T and John when I need to be absent from class. Hopefully that won't happen.</p>

      <p>Learned about Git & GitHub. Git is a local version of your file. GitHub is where you store your code. Also I need to rememer 127.0.0.1.8080.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>git init - initializing git</li>
        <li>git status - check to see if you have anything you haven't saved</li>
        <li>git add -A - adding all of files</li>
        <li>git push origin main - normally you don't push stuff to main other than first time</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Ashley explained to us about career development. Sounds like I need to create technical resume. I am a little nervous.</p>
      <p>Today in class, I learned more about git.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>git pull origin main - pull the code to main branch</li>
        <li>git branch -D setup - deleting the setup branch</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Learned more about group assignment. Excited for the first group. Folding text in Visual Studio Code is ALT + Z!</p>

      <h2>January 16th 2021</h2>
      <p>Leanred a lot about JavaScript basic. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>typeof -> tells you the data type</li>
        <li>Math.pow(2, 2) -> returns the base to the exponent power</li>
        <li>Math.round(6.5) -> returns the value of a number rounded to the nearest integer</li>
        <li>Math.floor(5.95) -> returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number</li>
        <li>Math.ceil(5.66) -> always rounds a number up to the next largest integer</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Also learned about 3 different types of functions. Probably need a separate page for functions.</p>

      <h2>January 19th 2021</h2>
      <p>JavaScript Arrays and Loops. Note for the day - if you can't explain what's in your code, don't use it. Use codes that you can explain yourself.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>.join(',') - Returns array as string. Default joins arrays with ",". You can add space.</li>
        <li>.split(',') - Divides a string into array. You have to tell exactly how to split. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Also here is a new function I learned today!</p>

      <>Another great day at Group Work. Working as a team trying to figure out assignment was fun. I read the instructions many times, but I could not fully comprehend what it meant. In the end, we figured it out.</p>
