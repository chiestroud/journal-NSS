        <li>git init - initializing git</li>
        <li>git status - check to see if you have anything you haven't saved</li>
        <li>git add -A - adding all of files</li>
        <li>git push origin main - normally you don't push stuff to main other than first time</li>

      <p>Leanred a lot about JavaScript basic. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>typeof -> tells you the data type</li>
        <li>Math.pow(2, 2) -> returns the base to the exponent power</li>
        <li>Math.round(6.5) -> returns the value of a number rounded to the nearest integer</li>
        <li>Math.floor(5.95) -> returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number</li>
        <li>Math.ceil(5.66) -> always rounds a number up to the next largest integer</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Also learned about 3 different types of functions. Probably need a separate page for functions.</p>

      <p>JavaScript Arrays and Loops. Note for the day - if you can't explain what's in your code, don't use it. Use codes that you can explain yourself.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>.join(',') - Returns array as string. Default joins arrays with ",". You can add space.</li>
        <li>.split(',') - Divides a string into array. You have to tell exactly how to split. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Also here is a new function I learned today!</p>
